      <p>
        The Dark Patterns Tip Line is led by a team of designers, academic researchers, legal experts, policy specialists, and advocacy-minded individuals.</p>
      <p>
        We came together to collect dark patterns to better understand how technology is exploiting people. Our ultimate vision is to leverage this data to combat manipulative practices online through policy reform.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have grounded this work by highlighting examples from peopleâ€™s lived experiences so we can best showcase how dark patterns lead to every day human harms.
